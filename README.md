# KRONEAKERS Online Footwear Store System

Project Overview: During my 3rd semsester, my colleagues and I developed the KRONEAKERS online footwear store system, a web-based application for KRONEAKERS, a Malaysian company specializing in trendy a
nd high-quality shoes for both men and women. The company aimed to improve its data management processes for its extensive product range and growing customer base. 
The system was designed to efficiently manage inventory, streamline order processing, and track customer information to enhance overall customer satisfaction and business efficiency.

Technologies Used: Oracle SQL Developer, PHP, CSS

Key Features and Achievements 

Product and Inventory Management: Developed a comprehensive system to maintain and manage product listings, including updating prices, adding new items, and tracking stock levels accurately. 
This feature ensured that inventory records remained up-to-date and minimized delays in order fulfillment.

Customer Information Tracking: Implemented functionality to store and manage customer details, including purchase history and preferences. 
This allowed the company to provide personalized services and marketing offers, improving customer engagement and satisfaction.

Order Processing Optimization: Automated the order processing workflow, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. The system tracked orders from placement to delivery, providing real-time status updates to customers.

Database Integration: Integrated Oracle SQL Developer with PHP to ensure a robust and efficient connection between the application and the database, allowing for real-time data access and updates.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive interface using CSS, making it easy for administrators to manage inventory and customer data, while also providing an engaging experience for end-users browsing and purchasing footwear online.

This project significantly improved my understanding of web development, particularly using PHP for backend logic and CSS for front-end design. 
I also gained practical experience in database management and integration using Oracle SQL Developer, enhancing my ability to create scalable and efficient web applications. 
Furthermore, working on this project sharpened my skills in data management, customer relationship management, and e-commerce system design, preparing me for future development roles in similar business environments.
